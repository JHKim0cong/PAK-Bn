The codes introduce a reliability analysis method by PAK-Bn. The codes are based on the paper "Kim J and Song J 2020" published at Structural Safety. The paper’s full reference information is as follows:

Kim, J., and J. Song (2020). Probability-Adaptive Kriging in n-Ball (PAK-Bn) for reliability analysis. Structural Safety. Vol. 85, 101924.
DOI: dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2020.101924

To implement Kriging (Gaussian Process regression) prediction, GPML toolbox in MATLAB is utilized. For more information of GPML toolbox, please refer "Gaussian Process for Machine Learning (Rasmussen, C.E., and C.K.I. Williams, 2006)" and http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/.

The main file of the code is 'PAK_Bn_main.m', and run this code after installing GPML toolbox
